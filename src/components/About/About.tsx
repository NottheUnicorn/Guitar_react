            mid-level guitars that don't get enough credit and are cheaper than the custom 
            shop guitars that cost 10s of thousands of dollars. However if you want to brag        
            a little, you're welcome to post a really nice guitar. Also, Partscasters and any
            self made guitar is more then welcome to be posted.</h2>
